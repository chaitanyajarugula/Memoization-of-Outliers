# Memoization-of-Outliers
### Implemented a python package for neural network from scratch and tested its performance on MNIST data-set with 60,000 images as input
### Computed the memoization and influence estimate values of each instance in the training part of the MNIST-1D on the instances of the testing part of the same data-set based on paper "What Neural Networks Memorize and why: Discovering the Long Tail via Influence Estimation".
